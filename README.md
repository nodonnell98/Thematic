# Thematic
A widget for changing a website's colour scheme that I created for a University of Plymouth Hackathon to fit the theme of the day

### Hackathon
The aim of the hackathon was to create whatever you wanted within 12 hours in order to fit the theme best.

There were four randomly generated words and we could use any number of them as the theme of our project.

These words were;
* Action
* Outcome
* Pusher
* Salsa

### The Idea

My idea was to create an in-browser widget that would allow a user to change the colour scheme of the website they were using (as long as the website had been created to support Thematic).

The four themes that a user would initially be able to pick from were of course Action, Outcome, Pusher and Salsa.

### Technologies

In order to create Thematic I used HTML, CSS and Javascript 

### Method
